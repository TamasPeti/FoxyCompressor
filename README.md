If you're like me and have **1.8TB of unorganized, uncompressed files** cluttering up your computer, FoxyCompressor is your one-stop shop for file compression and organization. It takes your messy folders, sorts them into neat categories, and compresses them to save up to **20x the space**! 🚀

## What Does It Do?

FoxyCompressor can handle a variety of tasks with ease:

- **Compress Images**: Converts your bulky `.jpg`, `.png`, and other image files into sleek `.webp` files **without losing quality**. 🖼️
- **Compress Videos**: Compresses your videos into smaller `.mp4` files using **FFmpeg**, with minimal visual loss (pretty much like the settings Facebook uses by default). 🎥
- **Compress Audio**: Packages your audio files into a tiny `.7z` archive. 🎵
- **Compress Documents**: Shrinks your documents into a compact `.7z` archive, saving **lots of space**! 📄
- **Organize Files**: Sorts files into categorized folders like **Images**, **Videos**, **Audio**, **Documents**, and **Other**. (More to come with **FoxyOrganizer**, the sister tool!) 🗂️

## Installation Guide

Follow these steps to get started:

### Step 1: Install Python
Ensure you have Python **3.7 or later** installed. If not, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org). 🐍

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the necessary libraries, including Pillow, py7zr, ffmpeg-python, and piexif. 🛠️
Step 3: Install FFmpeg (Windows Only)

FoxyCompressor uses FFmpeg for video compression. Here's how to set it up on Windows:

    Download FFmpeg: Grab the latest version from ffmpeg.org.
    Add FFmpeg to PATH: Add the bin folder from the FFmpeg download to your system’s PATH.
    Copy FFmpeg.exe: For good measure, copy ffmpeg.exe and paste it next to your python.exe (usually located in your Python installation folder, e.g., C:\Python39). 🐾

Step 4: Run FoxyCompressor

Navigate to the project folder and run:

```bash
python __main__.py
```

## How to Use

    Select Input and Output Folders: Choose the folder containing your messy files and the folder where you want the organized, compressed files to go.
    Click Start: Sit back and watch Foxo work its magic! 🦊✨
    Enjoy: Marvel at your beautifully organized and compressed files. 🎉

# License

FoxyCompressor is licensed under the AGPL v3 License. Do whatever you want with it, but don’t blame me if your files get too organized. 😉
If I sound too AI that is because I spent too long on writing the code and asked chatgpt to write this entire readme file 🤣😭
Also this is a very beta version! Enjoy <3

🦊 Happy Compressing! 🦊
